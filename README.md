# Interactive-Livestream-Platform-with-Customizable-Overlays
 This project is an interactive livestream platform where users can view RTSP streams with basic controls like play, pause, and volume. It allows customizable overlays such as logos and text on the video. A full CRUD API manages overlay settings, built using Python (Flask), React, and MongoDB for real-time streaming and flexibility.
